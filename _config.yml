  This site is focused on my personal interests, with an emphasis on Information Technology content. I am currently
  following the online full stack developer curriculum of theOdinProject.  Therefore, posts largely pertain to
  Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and my Operating System of Choice - Ubuntu.

  In order to get my blog up and running as quickly as possible, I built on the work of Louis Rassaby. The blog is 
  an open source Jekyll project, and hosted for free by GitHub Pages.

  I'm a career law enforcement officer in Northern Virginia, pursuing studies in the Information Technology field 
  to enhance my professional growth.

  I have experience investigating white collar crimes, as well as supervising a team of detectives investigating violent
  crimes. I have also supervised some programs that facilitate smooth and successful transitions for incarcerated offenders 
  preparing to [reenter][reentrynetwork] society.
