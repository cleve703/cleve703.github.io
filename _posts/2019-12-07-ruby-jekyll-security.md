It's been too long since I last posted, but I wanted to update everyone on my progress.  I have completed Web Development 101 at theOdinProject.org, and I'm 65% of the way through their Ruby course.  At this point, I think The Odin Project is an excellent resource for people like me who are committed to learning to code.

What I think sets The Odin Project apart from the other free online learning resources available is that it is open source and uses an adult learning approach.  Open source means that a community of coders continually ensures that all material in the course is relevant, on point and error free.  Adult learning, to me, means that the Odin Project uses an approach similar to taking a class at a university.  Unlike others, they do not attempt to centrally control your learning experience from their website.  In other words, some of the course material is found directly on their website, but much of it involves referring you to another online resource.  With so many great resources already out there, why try to reinvent the wheel?  They seem to provide an outstanding blend of existing online resources, in addition to their own content.  I also like that their curriculum requires you to use the same tools that professional developers use, essentially from day one. For example:

  * Linux terminal
  * Git
  * GitHub
  * Visual Studio Code (or another IDE)

So, at this point the Web Developent 101 provided a pretty solid introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.  I feel like it simply scratched the surface on Ruby on Rails and databases, which makes sense, particularly since Ruby on Rails requires a solid foundation in Ruby Programming.

Within the Ruby module, I have learned more about coding than I ever thought I would, and I'm only 65% complete.  I am currently working on a project to create methods pertaining to Binary Search Trees, and have begun learning a particular flavor of them known as Red Black Search Trees.

As if learning full stack developer skills is not enough, I am also launching this blog, and working on my CompTIA Security+ certification.  I am reading Darril Gibson's CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead, and found it to be surprisingly readable.  I can't yet attest to any results, but it comes highly recommended by many sources.  I am supplementing my reading with [Professor Messer's YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2VK7jq-s5A&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy).  I'll share more about what I learned about blogging and Jekyll in a future post.
