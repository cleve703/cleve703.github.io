As my second project of the JavaScript curriculum at [theOdinProject](http://theodinproject.com), I created a JavaScript Tic-tac-toe game. This project demonstrates using modules and factories to create objects.

Here are some links to check out my project:
* [Tic-tac-toe Game Live](https://codingcop-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com)
* [My HTML/CSS/JavaScript Code at GitHub](https://github.com/cleve703/tic-tac-toe)

I'm looking forward to building more projects with JavaScript. What has been your most helpful experience learning JavaScript? Let me know in the comments.
