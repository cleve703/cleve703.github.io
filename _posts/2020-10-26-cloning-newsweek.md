My latest assignment was to create an approximate clone of the Newsweek homepage using the Bootstrap 4 framework. It was a great experience learning the Bootstrap grid system, which is based on CSS Flexbox. Bootstrap also has a lot of elements built in, such as specialized buttons, navigation bars and more. I can see how frameworks such as Bootstrap make building responsive websites faster, easier and more efficient. Its built in elements also make it easier to have a consistent look when desired.

Some challenges encountered when building this project invovled keeping track of the numerous div elements required to build a large project. I quickly discovered just how important it is to ensure my elements are properly indented to show hierarchy. Another issue I encountered was that sometimes I encountered a situation where it seemed styling through Bootstrap would work, but due to the specifics of my application I had to transition to styling through CSS. That's one of the nice things about this kind of framework - you can use it to make your work easier, but you can always fall back on CSS when necessary.

I'm looking forward to building more projects with Bootstrap 4 and other web development frameworks. What is your favorite framework? Let me know in the comments.
