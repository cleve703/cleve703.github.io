I just completed my first assignment in the final chapter of my coding experience at [theOdinProject](http://theodinproject.com), a simple JavaScript library record webpage. This project demonstrates taking advantage of client-side JavaScript to add, modify and delete web content on the browser.

As I embark on developing greater competency with JavaScript, it is obvious how much JavaScript will help in enhancing the user experience associated with my websites and applications. JavaScript allows for instant modification of the appearance of an HTML page, without generating additional server traffic. This is a win-win for end users and businesses alike.

During my experience building this app, I learned about prototype object in JavaScript, which allows the developer to write a function one time, but access it through many objects associated with that prototype. I also enhanced my awareness of JavaScript syntax, particularly the importance of using double-parenthesis after function names.

Here are some links to check out my project:

* [My HTML/CSS Code at GitHub](https://github.com/cleve703/LibraryRecords)

I'm looking forward to building more projects with JavaScript. What has been your most helpful experience learning JavaScript? Let me know in the comments.
