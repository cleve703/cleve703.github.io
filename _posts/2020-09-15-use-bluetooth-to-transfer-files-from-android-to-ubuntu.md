I just completed one of the first projects in the HTML/CSS portion of the curriculum at [TheOdinPoject](https://theodinproject.org). This project involved cloning a New York Times article. The primary skills involved here included using the Web Developer Tools, as well as using CSS positioning tools such as flex and grid.

I used Mozilla Firefox's Web Developer Tools primarily because I like how easily it allows you to show and hide grid lines associated with flex and grid. I found myself gravitating toward CSS grid in at least one area of the page where the original developers used flex. I suppose I find grid to be a bit more developer friendly, particularly with its ability to name columns.

Please take a moment to view my version of the page and compare it to the original. Links are shown below:
