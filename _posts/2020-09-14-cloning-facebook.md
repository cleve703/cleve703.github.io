A few weeks ago, I completed one of the major projects in the Rails portion of the curriculum at [TheOdinPoject](https://theodinproject.org). This project creating a clone of the popular Facebook app. Creating a true clone of Facebook would be extremely time consuming, as there are so many facets to Facebook - Marketplace, Messenger, live video, etc. My clone, which I called Phacebook, captures some of the core elements of the original, such as secure login (made possible through Devise,) requesting/confirming friends, creating posts, including images in posts, as well as liking and commenting on posts.

This project was challenging because it tested so many aspects of my ability to code in Ruby on Rails. It was interesting learning how to customize the Devise rubygem to work with my app. I also enjoyed using Faker to create numerous fictitious user accounts for testing purposes. In conclusion, I thought it was pretty amazing that I, as a new developer, was able to create something similar to Facebook in my spare time.
